This is an Ecommerce website. 
In it, you can choose categories by gender as well as by type of clothing. 
There is a shopping cart and a favorites section. 
The site is bundled with a simple back-end based on JSON Server package. 
React Router Dom was used in the project.
I implemented also a Shop Cart and a Favourites page.
I created design following a Figma project.
I also implemented an Accordion and Bread Crumbs.
